AJAX mini project from Udacity course

This project is a single-page application I created within the Udacity FEND program to learn how to use AJAX requests.

This app features an input field for any address. On submitting the request, AJAX request to Google StreeView, Wikiepdia and the New York Times API are fired. The response from Google StreetView is used to set the background image for the current location. The responses from Wikiepdia and the New York Times  are featured in separate boxes.
